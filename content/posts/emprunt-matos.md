### The Project
"A specialized CRM for managing borrowing things

### Key Features:
* **Ergonomic UI:** It uses a "Social Feed" style UI that users are already familiar with..
* **Mutual Connections:** Showing if you share friends or social circles to lower the "stranger danger" barrier.
* **Live Scheduling:** A visual calendar where lenders can mark items as "busy" or "available."
