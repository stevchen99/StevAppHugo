### The Project
I designed and developed a **Time and Attendance** system used by 500+ employees. 

### Key Features:
* **Automated Clocking:** Employees log hours via a web interface or mobile app.
* **Complex Backend:** A Node JS that calculates overtime based on regional labor laws.
* **DevOps Integration:** Deployed via **Docker** containers with **Sonar** ensuring 90% code coverage.
